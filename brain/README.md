# Brain Configuration

This isn't a dotfile.  It's documentation on the commands
and configuration of how I use the tools themselves.  

## Purpose

Oftentimes when I'm trying to learn new things, I learn commands, shortcuts and things that make my life easier, and then promptly forget them.  I forget what I could do and how to do it.  

This is a place to document those things.  This is a brain dump of my process and abilities.
